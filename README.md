Agriculture Yield Predictor == https://yield-prediction-ag.streamlit.app/

This dataset contains agricultural data for 1,000,000 samples aimed at predicting crop yield (in tons per hectare) based on various factors. The dataset can be used for regression tasks in machine learning, especially for predicting crop productivity.

Region: The geographical region where the crop is grown (North, East, South, West).
Soil_Type: The type of soil in which the crop is planted (Clay, Sandy, Loam, Silt, Peaty, Chalky).
Crop: The type of crop grown (Wheat, Rice, Maize, Barley, Soybean, Cotton).
Rainfall_mm: The amount of rainfall received in millimeters during the crop growth period.
Temperature_Celsius: The average temperature during the crop growth period, measured in degrees Celsius.
Fertilizer_Used: Indicates whether fertilizer was applied (True = Yes, False = No).
Irrigation_Used: Indicates whether irrigation was used during the crop growth period (True = Yes, False = No).
Weather_Condition: The predominant weather condition during the growing season (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy).
Days_to_Harvest: The number of days taken for the crop to be harvested after planting.
Yield_tons_per_hectare: The total crop yield produced, measured in tons per hectare.
